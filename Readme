Lyapunov-based Non-Linear Tracking Control of a 2-link Robotic Manipulator

The objective of this project is to design, simulate, and compare the performance of three non-
linear controllers to perform a tracking task for a 2-link robot manipulator system which is subject
to uncertainties.
The three non-linear controllers to be studied are: Exact Model Knowledge (EMK), Adaptive
Control, and Sliding Mode Robust Control
This report comprises of non-linear control design and development of for each of the three
mentioned controllers along with the stability analysis for each controller. Except for the EMK
Controller, the controllers have been designed to account for uncertain system parameters. The
assumptions made during the design phase have been mentioned in the report. Simulation results
demonstrate the performance of each controller over time. All three controllers have been modeled
and simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK.


The controllers have been compared based on their stability, control effect, and their robustness.

Final Report Attached.
